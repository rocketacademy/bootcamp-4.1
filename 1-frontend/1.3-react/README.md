# React

## Learning Objectives

- Construct functional React components using JSX syntax to combine JavaScript and HTML-like markup.

- Implement the useState hook to create and manage state variables within React functional components.

- Apply the useEffect hook to handle side effects and lifecycle events in React applications.

- Develop React components that conditionally render UI elements based on props and component state.

- Evaluate different styling approaches in React, including inline styles, CSS stylesheets, and component libraries like React Bootstrap.

- Deploy a React application to GitHub Pages for online sharing

## Introduction

<a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">React</a> is a frontend framework and library that allows us to create custom, nest-able UI elements with a combination of HTML and JavaScript syntax (JSX). React's HTML-like structure makes it easy to visualise, and its integrated JS makes it easy to render dynamic data. Alternative but less popular frontend libraries include <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>.

We will use React's official <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank">guide</a> and <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to learn React, and the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank">Vitejs</a> environment to scaffold our first React apps. Vite is a build tool that provides a fast and lean development experience for modern web projects. Vite leverages new advancements in the JavaScript ecosystems, the ability of native ES modules within the browser and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages. This is because browsers do not read React natively; they read HTML, CSS and JS, not JSX.

The following sections provide Rocket's annotations to React's official <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank">guide</a> and <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to explain concepts that the React team assumes readers know.
