Please checkout the finished code in this <a href="https://github.com/rocketacademy/firebase-examples-3.2/tree/auth" target="_blank">repository</a>, ensure that you're on the `auth` branch. If you want to test out the application on your machine you will need to have registered an Application on Firebase with Realtime Database, Storage and Authentication activated. Use the `sample.env` within the application to create an `.env` file with your Firebase credentials. With this in mind if you want to run the application on your machine you will need to install the dependencies with the command `npm install` after the installation you can then run the application with the command `npm run dev`.  Then open a browser of your choice and navigate to  http://localhost:5173.
